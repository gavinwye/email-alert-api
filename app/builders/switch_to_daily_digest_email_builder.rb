      We've changed how often you get some emails from GOV.UK. We've done this to make the number of emails you get more manageable.

      You'll now get one email a day that will list any changes to:

      #{subscriptions.map { |subscription| "- #{subscription.subscriber_list.title}" }.join("\n")}

      If you do not get an email about those topics, it's because there have been no changes.

      We’ve not changed how often you get emails for any other GOV.UK subscriptions you may have. We’ve only changed the subscriptions listed in this email.

      # If you want to go back to immediate emails

      You can go back to getting immediate updates about these topics by [managing your subscriptions](#{manage_subscriptions_link}).
